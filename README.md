# Bone-Fratcture-Detection-using-OpenCv-

X-ray images are frequently used by doctors to diagnose fractures and broken bones, but are also used in other fields of medicine to locate 
objects or materials inside the body. The simple observation of doctors, however, can lead to incorrect diagnosis in many cases. As a result, it 
has been one of the most researched areas in the last decades to find ways to automate the diagnosis process for medical images. The main 
problem with x-ray images is that they may be blurry, out of focus, noisy, or even improperly bright, making examinations or analyses difficult.
In order to solve such problems, image processing approaches are being used that give more accurate results. In this project, we find 
applications of many image processing and computer vsion algorithms in a variety of contexts and problematic situations that require 
extensive x-ray image analysis to achieve more accurate results. Recent implementations have been commonly done using Python 
programming languages and the OpenCV library and also new aproaches employing machine learning techniques.
